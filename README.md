# Operating Systems Project - Shell Simulator

## Description

This project is designed to interact with the Windows operating system using various Python libraries. It provides functionalities to retrieve the system date and time from the BIOS, manage system processes and resources, and offer a graphical interface for user interaction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python libraries:
  - `tkinter`
  - `ctypes`
  - `psutil`
  - `shutil`
  - `datetime`
  - `os`
  - `time`

## System Resource Management

The script also uses the `psutil` library to manage and monitor system resources, such as CPU, memory, and disk usage. This allows for detailed information about system status and supports maintenance operations.

## Graphical Interface

`tkinter` is used to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates interaction with the script's functionalities. This includes displaying system information and executing specific commands through a user-friendly interface.
